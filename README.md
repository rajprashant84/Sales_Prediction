# Sales_Prediction
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization using Python. A prediction model is implemented using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).


## Key Features
- Comprehensive EDA and data visualization
- ANN-based prediction model
- Code is easy to understand for those familiar with machine learning and deep learning in Python

## Instructions
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform EDA to understand the dataset and extract meaningful insights.
   - Visualize the data using various Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

2. **Prediction Model:**
   - Implement a prediction model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
   - You can also experiment with different machine learning algorithms to build your own prediction model.

3. **Parameter Tuning:**
   - Adjust the parameters within the ANN to improve the accuracy of the model.
   - Experiment with different configurations and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
